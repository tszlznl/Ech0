## Quick Deployment

<!-- ### 🧙 One-click Script Deployment (Recommended; ensure your network can access GitHub Releases)
```shell
curl -fsSL "https://sh.soopy.cn/ech0.sh" -o ech0.sh && bash ech0.sh
``` -->

### 🐳 Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name ech0 \
  -p 6277:6277 \
  -v /opt/ech0/data:/app/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET="Hello Echos" \
  sn0wl1n/ech0:latest
```

> 💡 After deployment, access `ip:6277`  
> 🚷 For better security, replace `Hello Echos` in `-e JWT_SECRET="Hello Echos"` with your own secret  
> 📍 The first registered account becomes administrator (currently only admins can publish)  
> 🎈 Data is stored under `/opt/ech0/data`  

### 🐋 Docker Compose

Create a new directory and place your `docker-compose.yml` file there.

Run the following command in that directory:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

### ☸️ Kubernetes (Helm)

If you want to deploy Ech0 in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the Helm Chart provided by this project.

Since this project does not currently provide an online Helm repository, you need to clone the repository locally and install from the local directory.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/lin-snow/Ech0.git
    cd Ech0
    ```

2.  **Install with Helm:**
    ```shell
    # helm install <release-name> <chart-directory>
    helm install ech0 ./charts/ech0
    ```

    You can also customize the release name and namespace:
    ```shell
    helm install my-ech0 ./charts/ech0 --namespace my-namespace --create-namespace
    ```

---

## Upgrading

> ⚠️ Direct upgrade from v3 to v4 is not supported. Please export a snapshot in the v3 panel first, redeploy v4, then use "v3 Migration" in the v4 panel to import your existing data.

### 🔄 Docker

```shell
# Stop current container
docker stop ech0

# Remove container
docker rm ech0

# Pull latest image
docker pull sn0wl1n/ech0:latest

# Start new version
docker run -d \
  --name ech0 \
  -p 6277:6277 \
  -v /opt/ech0/data:/app/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET="Hello Echos" \
  sn0wl1n/ech0:latest
```

### 💎 Docker Compose

```shell
# Enter compose directory
cd /path/to/compose

# Pull latest image and recreate
docker-compose pull && \
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate

# Clean old images
docker image prune -f
```

### ☸️ Kubernetes (Helm)

1. **Update repository:**
   Enter your local Ech0 repository and pull latest changes.
   ```shell
   cd Ech0
   git pull
   ```

2. **Upgrade Helm release:**
   Use `helm upgrade` to update your release.
   ```shell
   # helm upgrade <release-name> <chart-directory>
   helm upgrade ech0 ./charts/ech0
   ```
   If you used a custom release name and namespace, use matching values:
   ```shell
   helm upgrade my-ech0 ./charts/ech0 --namespace my-namespace
   ```

## FAQ

1. **What is Ech0?**  
   Ech0 is a lightweight open-source self-hosted platform designed for quickly publishing and sharing personal thoughts, writing, and links. It provides a clean interface and distraction-free experience, and all data is stored locally for full user control.

2. **What is Ech0 not?**  
   Ech0 is not a traditional professional note-taking app (such as Obsidian or Notion). Its core usage is closer to a social feed / microblog stream.

3. **Is Ech0 free?**  
   Yes. Ech0 is fully free and open source under AGPL-3.0, with no ads, tracking, subscriptions, or service lock-in.

4. **How do I back up and import data?**  
   Since all content is stored in local SQLite files, regularly back up `/opt/ech0/data` (or your mapped data path). Online data management supports "Snapshot Export" and "Migration Import": export for offline archiving, import through migration.

5. **Does Ech0 support RSS?**  
   Yes. Ech0 supports RSS subscriptions so you can follow updates in RSS readers.

6. **Why does publishing fail with "contact administrator"?**  
   In the current design, only administrators can publish content. After deployment, the first registered user is automatically assigned as system administrator. Other users cannot publish unless granted permission.

7. **Why is there no detailed permission matrix?**  
   Ech0 keeps things simple and lightweight by design. Instead of a complex permission system, it currently distinguishes only admin and non-admin roles to keep usage smooth.

8. **Why can't others see their Connect avatar?**  
   Set your current instance URL in `System Settings - Service URL`, for example `https://memo.vaaat.com` (must include `http://` or `https://`).

9. **What is the MetingAPI option in settings?**  
   It is the API service used to resolve direct music streaming links for shared music cards. If not configured, it defaults to the API provided by Ech0 (deployed on Vercel).

10. **Why does a newly added Connect show only partial results?**  
    The backend tries to fetch instance information for all Connect entries. If an instance is down or unreachable, it is discarded, and only valid/accessible Connect data is returned to the frontend.

11. **What content is not recommended for Ech0?**  
    Ech0 content is composed of text, images, and extension content (such as music/video cards). Dense posts that combine `text + images + extension content` are not recommended because they conflict with some Ech0 design principles. In general, posting extension-heavy content or long-form articles is also discouraged.

12. **How do I enable comments?**  
    In `Comment Settings`, choose a comment service and fill in the required parameters. Currently supports `Twikoo / Waline / Artalk / Giscus`; required fields are shown dynamically in the UI.

13. **How do I configure S3 storage?**  
    Fill in required values in storage settings. Note: endpoint should not include `http://` or `https://`, and the bucket must allow public access.

14. **How do I enable passkey login?**  
    In `SSO - Passkey`, configure `WebAuthn RP ID` and `WebAuthn Origins`. After saving and seeing "Passkey ready", follow browser prompts to bind biometrics or a security key.

## Project Architecture

- The backend event bus has switched to [Busen](https://github.com/lin-snow/Busen): it uses a typed-first in-process architecture, and improves stability through explicit backpressure, hooks, and drain shutdown.

---

## Development Guide
### Backend Requirements
📌 **Go 1.26.0+**

📌 **C Compiler**
When using CGO-dependent libraries such as `go-sqlite3`, install:
- Windows:
    - [MinGW-w64](https://winlibs.com/)
    - Add the `bin` directory to `PATH` after extraction
- macOS: `brew install gcc`
- Linux: `sudo apt install build-essential`

📌 **Google Wire**
Install [wire](https://github.com/google/wire) for dependency injection file generation:
- `go install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire@latest`

📌 **Golangci-Lint**
Install [Golangci-Lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) for linting and formatting:
- Run `golangci-lint run` in the project root for linting
- Run `golangci-lint fmt` in the project root for formatting

📌 **Air (Optional, Backend Hot Reload)**
- Recommended via Makefile: `make air-install`
- Or install manually: `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`

📌 **Swagger**
Install [Swagger](https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger) to generate/use OpenAPI docs:
- Run `swag init -g internal/server/server.go -o internal/swagger` in project root to generate or update Swagger docs
- Visit `http://localhost:6277/swagger/index.html` in your browser to view and use docs

📌 **Event Runtime Parameters (Busen)**
- `ECH0_EVENT_DEFAULT_BUFFER` / `ECH0_EVENT_DEFAULT_OVERFLOW`
- `ECH0_EVENT_DEADLETTER_BUFFER` / `ECH0_EVENT_SYSTEM_BUFFER`
- `ECH0_EVENT_AGENT_BUFFER` / `ECH0_EVENT_AGENT_PARALLELISM`
- `ECH0_EVENT_INBOX_BUFFER`
- `ECH0_EVENT_WEBHOOK_POOL_WORKERS` / `ECH0_EVENT_WEBHOOK_POOL_QUEUE`

### Frontend Requirements
📌 **NodeJS v25.5.0+, PNPM v10.30.0+**
> Note: if you need multiple Node.js versions, use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to manage them.

---

### Start Backend & Frontend
**Step 1: Backend (in Ech0 root directory)**
```shell
make run # normal backend start (equivalent to go run main.go serve)
make dev # backend hot reload with Air
```
> If dependency injection relationships change, run `wire` first in `ech0/internal/di/` to regenerate `wire_gen.go`.

**Step 2: Frontend (new terminal)**
```shell
cd web # enter frontend directory

pnpm install # run if dependencies are not installed

pnpm dev # start frontend preview
# or run from project root: make web-dev
```

**Step 3: After both are running**
Frontend preview: `http://localhost:5173` (actual port shown in terminal after start)  
Backend preview: `http://localhost:6277` (default backend port is 6277)  

> When importing packages in a layered architecture, use standardized alias names:  
> model layer: `xxxModel`  
> util layer: `xxxUtil`  
> handler layer: `xxxHandler`  
> service layer: `xxxService`  
> repository layer: `xxxRepository`
