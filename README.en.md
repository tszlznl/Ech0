## Quick Deployment
<!-- 
### 🧙 One-Click Script Deployment (Recommended, make sure your network can access GitHub Release)
```shell
curl -fsSL "https://sh.soopy.cn/ech0.sh" -o ech0.sh && bash ech0.sh
``` -->

### 🐳 Docker (Recommended)

```shell
docker run -d \
  --name ech0 \
  -p 6277:6277 \
  -v /opt/ech0/data:/app/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET="Hello Echos" \
  sn0wl1n/ech0:latest
```

> 💡 After deployment, access `ip:6277` to use  
> 🚷 It is recommended to change `JWT_SECRET="Hello Echos"` to a secure secret  
> 📍 The first registered user will be set as administrator  
> 🎈 Data stored under `/opt/ech0/data`

### 🐋 Docker Compose

1. Create a new directory and place `docker-compose.yml` inside.  
2. Run:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

### ☸️ Kubernetes (Helm)

If you want to deploy Ech0 in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the Helm Chart provided in this project.

Since this project does not provide an online Helm repository, you need to clone the repository to your local machine first, and then install from the local directory.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/lin-snow/Ech0.git
    cd Ech0
    ```

2.  **Install with Helm:**
    ```shell
    # helm install <release-name> <chart-directory>
    helm install ech0 ./charts/ech0
    ```

    You can also customize the release name and namespace:
    ```shell
    helm install my-ech0 ./charts/ech0 --namespace my-namespace --create-namespace
    ```

---

## Upgrading

### 🔄 Docker

```shell
docker stop ech0
docker rm ech0
docker pull sn0wl1n/ech0:latest
docker run -d \
  --name ech0 \
  -p 6277:6277 \
  -v /opt/ech0/data:/app/data \
  -e JWT_SECRET="Hello Echos" \
  sn0wl1n/ech0:latest
```

### 💎 Docker Compose

```shell
cd /path/to/compose
docker-compose pull && \
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
docker image prune -f
```

### ☸️ Kubernetes (Helm)

1.  **Update the repository:**
    Navigate to your local Ech0 repository directory and pull the latest changes.
    ```shell
    cd Ech0
    git pull
    ```

2.  **Upgrade the Helm Release:**
    Use the `helm upgrade` command to update your release.
    ```shell
    # helm upgrade <release-name> <chart-directory>
    helm upgrade ech0 ./charts/ech0
    ```
    If you used a custom release name and namespace, use the corresponding names:
    ```shell
    helm upgrade my-ech0 ./charts/ech0 --namespace my-namespace
    ```

## FAQ

1. **What is Ech0?**  
   A lightweight, open-source self-hosted platform for quickly sharing thoughts, writings, and links. All content is locally stored.  

2. **What Ech0 is NOT?**  
   Not a professional note-taking app like Obsidian or Notion; its core function is similar to social feed/microblog.  

3. **Is Ech0 free?**  
   Yes, fully free and open-source under AGPL-3.0, no ads, tracking, subscription, or service dependency.  

4. **How do I back up and import data?**  
  Since all content is stored in a local SQLite file, it is recommended to regularly back up files in `/opt/ech0/data` (or your mapped data path). In "Data Management", you can use snapshot export for archival and migration import as the only supported online data import path.

5. **Does Ech0 support RSS?**  
   Yes, content updates can be subscribed via RSS.  

6. **Why can't I publish content?**  
   Only administrators can publish. First registered user is admin.  

7. **Why no detailed permission system?**  
   Ech0 emphasizes simplicity: admin vs non-admin only, for smooth experience.  

8. **Why Connect avatars may not show?**  
   Set your instance URL in `System Settings - Service URL` (with `http://` or `https://`).  

9. **What is MetingAPI?**  
   Used to parse music streaming URLs for music cards. If empty, default API provided by Ech0 is used.  

10. **Why not all Connect items show?**  
    Instances that are offline or unreachable are ignored; only valid instances are displayed.  

11. **What content is not recommended?**  
    Avoid publishing dense content mixing text + images + extension cards. Long posts or extension cards alone are okay.  

12. **How to enable comments?**  
    Set up Twikoo backend URL in settings. Only Twikoo is supported.  

13. **How to configure S3?**  
    Fill in endpoint (without http/https) and bucket with public access.

14. **How to enable passkey login?**  
  Open settings, enable Passkey, then bind your biometric or hardware security key following browser prompts.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./docs/imgs/Ech0技术架构图.svg)  
> by ExcaliDraw

- The backend event bus now uses [Busen](https://github.com/lin-snow/Busen), adopting a typed-first in-process model with explicit backpressure, hooks, and drain-style shutdown.

## Development Guide

### Backend Requirements
- Go 1.26.0+  
- C Compiler for CGO (`go-sqlite3`):
  - Windows: [MinGW-w64](https://winlibs.com/)  
  - macOS: `brew install gcc`  
  - Linux: `sudo apt install build-essential`  
- Google Wire: `go install github.com/google/wire/cmd/wire@latest`  
- Golangci-Lint: `golangci-lint run` / `golangci-lint fmt`  
- Air (optional, backend hot reload): `make air-install` or `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`  
- Swagger: `swag init -g internal/server/server.go -o internal/swagger`  
- Event runtime tuning (Busen):
  - `ECH0_EVENT_DEFAULT_BUFFER` / `ECH0_EVENT_DEFAULT_OVERFLOW`
  - `ECH0_EVENT_DEADLETTER_BUFFER` / `ECH0_EVENT_SYSTEM_BUFFER`
  - `ECH0_EVENT_AGENT_BUFFER` / `ECH0_EVENT_AGENT_PARALLELISM`
  - `ECH0_EVENT_INBOX_BUFFER`
  - `ECH0_EVENT_WEBHOOK_POOL_WORKERS` / `ECH0_EVENT_WEBHOOK_POOL_QUEUE`

### Frontend Requirements
- NodeJS v25.5.0+, PNPM v10.30.0+  
- Use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) if multiple Node versions needed

### Start Backend & Frontend
```shell
# Backend
make run # normal backend start (equivalent to go run main.go serve)
make dev # backend hot reload with Air

# Frontend
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# or from project root: make web-dev
```

Preview: Backend `http://localhost:6277`, Frontend `http://localhost:5173`

> When importing layered packages, prefer consistent aliases such as `xxxModel`, `xxxService`, `xxxRepository`, and so on.
