## Welcome to React Router!

A modern, production-ready template for building full-stack React applications using React Router.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/default)

## Features

- 🚀 SPA mode (client-rendered; deploy `build/client`)
- ⚡️ Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- 📦 Asset bundling and optimization
- 🔄 Data loading and mutations
- 🔒 TypeScript by default
- 🎉 TailwindCSS for styling
- 📖 [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

Output is **`build/client/`** (static SPA). Point your CDN or static host at that folder. For client-side routes, configure the host to fall back to `index.html` (this repo includes `public/_redirects` for Netlify-style hosts).

Local preview of the built files:

```bash
pnpm start
```

(`serve -s build/client`)

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
